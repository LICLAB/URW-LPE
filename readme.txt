We developed an integrative bioinformatics method, denoted URW-LPE, for identification of functional lncRNAs in ESCC. In brief, a random walk was run with each dysregulated lncRNA/PCG as a seed and an extended co-expression relation as an edge. First, an extended lncRNA-PCG co-expression network was constructed based on differentially-expressed lncRNAs and PCGs in ESCC. Second, we ran the random walk for the network, considering the fold change (FC) values of each node on the network as the initial probability vector. As a result, each lncRNA in the network would be given an URWScore value. The higher URWScore value of lncRNAs represents more important functions in ESCC. Finally, FDR corrected P-values for each lncRNA in the network was calculated through comparison of the real URWScore of each lncRNA and that of the background distribution. This method can identify lncRNAs based on global network information, which usually represents indirect target relations. Compared with other methods, we focused more on considering dysregulated lncRNAs/PCGs as a search source, and performing global searching within the ESCC-specific lncRNA-PCG co-expression network. 
  To identify the statistically significant lncRNAs, P-values for each lncRNA in the network was calculated through comparison of the real URWScore of each lncRNA and that of the background distribution. For lncRNAs in the network, we randomly generated FC values of each lncRNAs from normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as real FC values of lncRNAs. For PCGs in the network, FC values of PCGs in the network were shuffled. URWScore of each lncRNA was re-computed using the above random walk method. Total of 1,230,000 (615*2000) URWScore of lncRNAs was generated and used as background distribution. The P-value is the fraction of the number of lncRNAs, which is larger than that in the real URWScore. FDR-corrected P-values for each lncRNA in the network were calculated using the Benjamini¨CHochberg FDR method.
